# SportsWebScraper
The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with the multiple different options of frameworks and libraries available for web scraping. So I created 3 scrapers for NFL, MLB and NBA which retrieve their data from a [sports site](http://sports-reference.com) and writes to a csv file for each specific team.

## Technologies
I used 3 web sracping tools during this project:
  - [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)
  - [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/)
  - [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
  - [Tinkter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
    - I used this to create a simple GUI to simply run and select which scraper the user desires to run
